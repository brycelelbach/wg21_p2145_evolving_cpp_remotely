# Introduction # {#introduction}

Due to the ongoing global health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, the
  ISO C++ Committee's planned June 2020 meeting in Varna, Bulgaria was called
  off.
During this uncertain time, our priority must be the safety and well-being of
  the committee and the public at large.

The postponement of the Varna meeting and the broader impacts of the novel
  coronavirus on society will be disruptive.
However, the ISO C++ Committee can and will do our best to adapt to these
  disruptions and carry on our work in these trying times.
Our plans for C++23 and beyond ([[P0592R4]]) have not changed, but the way that
  we execute on those plans will have to change.
This document lays out plans for how we will conduct Library Evolution work
  remotely.

# Library Evolution Work Performed at Face-to-Face Meetings # {#work-at-f2f-meetings}

At a typical ISO C++ Committee face-to-face meeting,
  [[#appendix-typical-lewg-f2f-schedule|the Library Evolution group meets for 33.25 hours]]
  and
  [[#appendix-historical-lewgi-f2f-schedule|the Library Evolution Incubator group meets for 24.8 hours]];
  a total of ~58 hours per meeting.
Each year, we spend ~174 hours at face-to-face meetings on Library Evolution.

A lot of voluntary and informal, but important, work also occurs during meals
  and at in the evening hours.

The main benefits of a face-to-face meeting over remote meetings are:

- The informal, spontaneous, and serendipitous interactions between committee
      members in hallways, at meals, etc.
- Sequestration, which limits distractions and increases focus.
- Discussions happen consecutively, which keeps them "in cache".

We can't replicate these effects in remote meetings.

When in session at face-to-face meetings, we typically perform three activities:

- <dfn><abbr>Information Distribution</abbr>, where knowledgable parties
      educate the committee about a subject.</dfn>
- <dfn><abbr>Review</abbr>, where the committee identifies open questions
      and places where we lack clear consensus.</dfn>
- <dfn><abbr>Decision Making</abbr>, where the committee answers open
      questions and we determine consensus on particular matters.</dfn>

# Mechanisms for Remote Collaboration # {#mechanisms-for-remote-meetings}

We have three primary mechanisms for remote collaboration:

- <dfn><abbr>Mailings</abbr>, which are regular distributions of committee
      proposals.
    Mailings are a good way to
      [=Information Distribution|distribute information=].</dfn>
- <dfn><abbr>Email List Discussions</abbr>, which are good for
      [=information distribution=] and [=review=].
    They are not as effective for [=decision making=] as it can be hard to
      determine consensus.
    Email list discussions are asynchronous, so everyone can participate when
      it is convenient for them.</dfn>
- <dfn><abbr>Telecons</abbr>, which are good for [=information distribution=],
      [=review=], and [=decision making=].
    However, they are synchronous by nature, which introduces scheduling
      constraints that limits participation and makes them a scarce resource.</dfn>

# Telecons # {#telecons}

Because [=telecons=] are the only good option for [=decision making=] and they
  are a scarce resource, we should try to use them for [=decision making=] as
  much as possible.
That means we should do as much
  [=Information Distribution|distribution of information=]
  and [=review=] outside of [=telecons=] as possible.
It is important that participants read the proposals that will be discussed on
  a [=telecon=] before the [=telecon=], and utilize [=email list discussions=]
  whenever possible.

## Duration and Cadence of Telecons ## {#telecon-duration-and-cadence}

As mentioned earlier in [[#work-at-f2f-meetings]], we spend ~174
  hours per year on Library Evolution at face-to-face meetings.
This is an average of ~3.3 hours per week (~4 months per committee meeting
  equivalent).

~3.3 hours per week is a slightly larger commitment than reasonable, especially
  given that other parts of the committee will also be meeting remotely.
If some part of the [=information distribution=] and [=review=] that occurs at
  face-to-face committee meetings can happen via [=email list discussions=]
  [=message platforms=] instead of [=telecons=], it should not be necessary for
  us to make up all of the time of face-to-face meetings via [=telecons=].

There are tradeoffs in selecting a duration for individual telecons.
Longer telecons can be harder to schedule and can strain the endurance of
  participants.
Shorter telecons are easier to schedule and may draw greater attendance, but
  disrupt the continuity of discussions.

Given the committee's global nature, it is difficult to find times that are
  convenient for all committee members.
Instead of always holding weekly meetings at a single time, we should either
  meet multiple times per week or meet once per week but have two time-slots
  which alternate each week.
This will give us additional scheduling flexibility.

Given all of this, **we will meet ~1.5 hours per week, from April 2020 until
  at least September 2020**.

This is about 50% of time commitment that we would have made to the Varna 2020
  meeting.
If this cadence and duration proves to be too much, we will adjust by scaling
  back and cancelling meetings.

## Telecon Platform ## {#telecon-platform}

Our [=telecon=] platform needs to be able to support the following:

- Supports video chat.
- Supports audio over internet or via phone line.
- Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices.
- Attendee hand raising.
    - The hand queue should show the order in which hands were raised.
    - The [=telecon=] organizer should to be able to lower raised hands.
- Attendee polling.
    - Multiple types of polls should be supported: at least 5-way and 3-way polls.
    - The [=telecon=] organizer should be able to clear votes.
- Attendee renaming by [=telecon=] organizer.
- Meeting recording.

<a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a>, the official ISO [=telecon=] platform,
  supports most of these features, and the committee has field experience using
  this platform to hold [=telecons=].
So, that's what we'll use.

## No Separate Library Evolution Incubator Telecons ## {#no-separate-lewgi-telecons}

The primary reason that the Library Evolution Incubator group meets separately
  and concurrently with the Library Evolution group is due to the time
  constraints of our physical meetings.

For remote meetings, we do not have the same kind of time constraints that force
  concurrent sessions of the Library Evolution group and the Library Evolution
  Incubator group.
As such, there does not seem to be much value in holding separate [=telecons=].

All [=telecon=] discussions will be considered joint exercises of the Library
  Evolution group and the Library Evolution Incubator group.

## Decision Making ## {#telecon-decision-making}

We will make decisions on [=telecons=] via straw polls, just as we do at
  face-to-face meetings.

Any decisions made on [=telecons=] will be considered "Tentatively Ready".

For forwarding of proposals to other subgroups, this means that the paper will
  be forwarded on the ISO C++ GitHub for paper tracking, but marked with the
  "Tentatively Ready" tag.
At the start of the next face-to-face meeting, we will briefly go through the
  list of "Tentatively Ready" proposals that were forwarded to see if anyone
  has new information or new perspectives that warrant revisiting those proposals.

For all "Tentatively Ready" decisions made on [=telecons=], after the [=telecon=]
  a message will be sent to the relevant email lists with a summary of the
  decisions, to give anyone who did not attend the [=telecon=] a chance to voice
  their opinion.

## Telecon Quorum ## {#telecon-quorum}

We expect to have lower attendance on [=telecons=] than we would have at
  face-to-face meetings.

We do not have readily accessible data for attendance in the Library Evolution
  group, but it is typically between 15 and 30 people.
[[#appendix-historical-lewgi-f2f-attendance|Average attendance in the Library Evolution Incubator is 17 people]].

Quorum is not merely a function of the quantity of people in the room.
For quorum, we need to have both the right people and the right quantity of
  them.

That said, if we have fewer than 12 participants on any given Library Evolution
  [=telecon=], it will be difficult for us to make meaningful decisions.
In such a circumstance, we would avoid [=decision making=] and instead use our
  time for [=review=] and [=information distribution=].

## Telecon Chairing ## {#telecon-chairing}

Running weekly telecons is not a small amount of effort.
Fortunately, we have five chairs available, so we can distribute the burden
  amongst ourselves.

## Telecons Aren't Mandatory ## {#telecons-arent-mandatory}

If you are a stakeholder on a particular proposal or subject, you are strongly
  encouraged to attend telecons on that proposal or subject.
However, telecon attendance is encouraged but not mandatory.

**Missing a telecon does not prevent your voice from being heard.**
If a decision is made on a telecon and you feel you have a new perspective or
  new information that was not considered, you should make the committee aware
  via [=email list discussion=].
As with face-to-face meetings, we can always revisit decisions if we have new
  information.
